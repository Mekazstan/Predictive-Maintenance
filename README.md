    'Air temperature [K]': [298.8]
    This represents the air temperature in Kelvin (K) during the industrial process. 
    Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale, and in this case, the air temperature is approximately 298.8 Kelvin.
    
    'Process temperature [K]': [308.7]
    This represents the process temperature in Kelvin (K) during the industrial process. 
    The process temperature is approximately 308.7 Kelvin.
    
    'Rotational speed [rpm]': [1497]
    This represents the rotational speed of a component in the machinery, measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). 
    In this case, the rotational speed is approximately 1497 revolutions per minute.
    
    'Torque [Nm]': [46.8]
    This represents the torque applied to the machinery, measured in Newton-meters (Nm). 
    The torque is approximately 46.8 Newton-meters. Torque (Force that tends to cause rotation)
    
    'Tool wear [min]': [72]
    This represents the cumulative time the tool has been in operation or in use, measured in minutes. 
    The tool has been in use for approximately 72 minutes since the start of its operation.
    
    A confusion matrix provides a more detailed and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of your classification model.
    The confusion matrix provides information on true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). 
    These values can be helpful for understanding where your model is making errors and can guide further improvements or adjustments.

    Accuracy: How often it is correct. (Opposite == Misclassification)
    Recall: When it's actually yes,how often does it predict "YES" (TRUE POSITIVE)
    (FALSE POSITIVE)
    Specificity: (TRUE NEGATIVE)
    Precision: When predicted as yes how often is it correct.
